                                             Open source is a term that originally referred to open source software (OSS). 
                                             Open source software is code that is designed to be publicly accessibleâ€”anyone can see, modify, and distribute 
                                             the code as they see fit.
                                             Open source software is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way,
                                             relying on peer review and community production. Open source software is often cheaper,
                                             more flexible, and has more longevity than its proprietary peers because it is developed
                                             by communities rather than a single author or company.                                            </p>
